Simple Billing System - Python Console App

👋 About the Project:
---------------------
This is a basic billing system I made using Python. It runs in the terminal/command prompt.
You can add items, calculate the bill with GST (18%), save it as a text file, and even view or delete old bills.

I made this to practice Python file handling, loops, and basic logic — something a shopkeeper or small store owner might actually use.

🛠️ Features:
------------
1. Create a new bill with item name, quantity, and price.
2. Calculates subtotal, GST (18%), and final total.
3. Saves each bill in the "bills" folder with a unique file name.
4. Option to view existing bills and see the summary (Subtotal, GST, Total).
5. Also lets you delete any old bill if no longer needed.

📁 Project Folder Structure:
----------------------------
billing_system/
├── main.py          → Main program file
├── bills/           → Folder where bills are saved (as .txt files)
└── README.txt       → You're reading it 😊

🚀 How to Run:
--------------
1. Make sure Python is installed (version 3.x is fine).
2. Open terminal or command prompt.
3. Go into the project folder and run:
   python main.py
4. Follow the menu instructions shown in terminal.

📌 Notes:
---------
- This project only uses built-in Python modules (`os`, `datetime`, etc.)
- All bills are stored in plain `.txt` files.
- No external libraries or GUI used — just simple and easy to understand.

✅ Ideal For:
-------------
- Beginners learning Python
- Students who's doing mini projects
- Small shops who want a basic offline billing system

Hope it's helpful to someone!
